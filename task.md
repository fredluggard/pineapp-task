# Task: Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board

## üìå Objective

Build a draggable Kanban-style task board, using React and TailwindCSS, showcasing your frontend skills and ability to deliver polished user experiences.
The image for this task [can be found here (kanban-board.png)](./kanban-board.png). You are not limited to the design in the image but your design must meet the following requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

The board must include at least three columns as shown in the image (e.g. To Do, In Progress, Done).

Each column should contain task cards with a title and a description

### Users must be able to:

- Add new cards to any column

- Drag and drop cards both between columns and within the same column to reorder

- Persist board state in localStorage, so the layout remains on page refresh. Do not use any statemanagement library for this.

Technology restriction: Only React and TailwindCSS may be used (No UI component library is allowed _including shadcn_).  
Optional libraries such as a drag-and-drop utility are allowed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bonus (Nice-to-have but not required)

- Edit/Delete card functionality
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Mobile-responsive layout with horizontal scrolling

## ‚è≥ Timeframe

You have 24 hours from the time the task is sent to complete and submit your solution.
