## A React-Based Mini Kanban Board Task

[Checkout task.md for instructions](./task.md)

## My Solution — by Fred

A simple and functional Kanban-style task board built using modern React tools.

---

## Stack Used

- **Next.js** (v15.4.6)
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4.1)
- **@dnd-kit** – For drag-and-drop functionality
- **TypeScript**

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate into the project directory
cd kanban-taskboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Assumption

I assummed that no state management libraray means you don't want a global state so I tried passing all my data and functions through props

Also I didn't use icons library to try to give the dark mode toggle a cool look because of the no library instruction

Since the task didn't require me to keep track of different functionality in the task for version control, I did everything in one commit.
